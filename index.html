    <h1>My Story</h1>

    <img src="DressBlues.jpg" alt="Andres in Dress Uniform" height="250px"/>

    <p id="first">Hello readers, my name is Andres Ibarra and I was born in Colombia and raised in Queens New York. I am the oldest of five children and I am actually 17 years older than my younger brother. I graduated highschool in 2002 and joined the Army shortly after graduation. During my 15 year career in the Army I was deployed 4 times to Iraq and 2 to Afghanistan. I had the opportunity to meet great people and leaders along the way that have influenced my life in many ways. Below you will find a list of when and where I deployed to during my career.</p>

    <p id="second">During the last 6 years of my military career I was a Systems Integrator for Air Defense Weapons and Command and Control Systems. A lot of my job involved making sure systems were always operastional and advicing commanders about decicions on ground and air assets in the immediate battle space. It sounds a lot cooler than it actually was.</p>

    <h3>Retirement</h3>
    <p id="third"> After nearly 15 years, I medically retired from service on 31 August 2017. Unfortunately I was not able to continue to 20 years of service, but I am excited for the new opportunities that are presenting themselves. During preparations for retirement, I had the fortune of meeting a few people that work at Amazon who encourage me to look into becoming a software developer. I began my research into schools and coding bootcamps to see which one would best fit me and my family. Code fellows was clearly my top choice after narrowing it down to 3 schools, and it helped that they allowed for the use of GI Bill. I am currently on my second day of Code 201 course and so far I feel lost and confused, but excited for things to come.</P>
